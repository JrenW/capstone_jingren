## Abstract

Thanks to the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) movement, self-learning has become more efficient by home-watching lecture videos curated by top universities around the world. However, few self learners can really sit through, say, a three-hour Cambridge lecture video on Information Theory. In fact, 90% of MOOCs students drop out quickly after 2-week enrollment. Although lecture videos are great for knowledge dissemination, its heavy length and lack of interactivity often stifles “Active Learning”, the power engine of one’s life-long intellectual growth. <br>
With a vision to make the MOOCs experience much more ‘active’ for the benefits of self-learners, my project aims to turn passive video ‘watching’ into active video ‘reading’ by interacting with features 'with-IN' the video frame. First, the project will explore various machine-learning algorithms on automatic video content extraction & learning; then apply learning results to build a web interface with features like 1) caption-based content search within a lecture videos; 2) video moment annotation toolbox; and 3) video-to-video hyperlinks for nonlinear content navigation. 
The final product is going to be a working web app running on Flask virtual server which takes in a youtube video link and displays interactive features stated above.
